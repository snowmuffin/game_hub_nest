# Icon Uploads Directory

This directory stores DDS icon files uploaded from Space Engineers game.

## Structure
- Files are stored with sanitized filenames extracted from game paths
- Example: `Textures\GUI\Icons\Cubes\LargeBlockArmorBlock.dds` → `LargeBlockArmorBlock.dds`

## Access
- Files are accessible via: `/uploads/icons/{filename}`
- Served by Express static middleware (configured in main.ts)

## Maintenance
- Consider implementing cleanup for old/unused files
- Monitor disk usage as icon count grows
- Future: migrate to S3/CDN for production scalability
